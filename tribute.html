              Published "An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to Use
              Means for the Conversion of the Heathens" advocating missionary
              work. Some have claimed that this work was a response to a public
              rebuke he received from John Ryland Senior at a ministers meeting
              in 1787. The rebuke was along the lines of: "Young man, sit down.
              When God pleases to convert the heathen, He will do it without
              your aid or mine!" This rebuke reflected the prevailing sentiment
              of the time, which was skeptical of organized missionary efforts
              and believed that conversion of non-Christians was solely within
              God's control.

          <h1>Interesting Facts About William Carey</h1>
          <ul class="facts">
            <li>
              Carey was a polyglot who learned Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, and
              Dutch on his own. He later mastered several Indian languages
              including Bengali, Sanskrit, and Marathi.
            </li>
            <li>
              Besides his missionary work, Carey was an avid botanist. He
              established the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India in
              1820.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carey translated the Bible into multiple Indian languages,
              including Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Hindi, Marathi, and Sanskrit.
              His work made the scriptures accessible to millions of people in
              India.
            </li>
            <li>
              He set up the first printing press in India at Serampore. This
              press not only printed religious texts but also educational
              materials in various Indian languages. Carey was instrumental in
              translating the entire Bible into 6 languages and parts of the
              Bible into 29 other languages and dialects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Often referred to as the "Father of Modern Missions," Carey
              revolutionized the missionary approach with his emphasis on
              cultural adaptation and long-term commitment to the local
              community.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carey was a strong advocate for education. He founded Serampore
              College in 1818, which became the first degree-awarding
              institution in Asia. He believed in educating both men and women
              and established schools for children of all castes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carey campaigned against social evils such as infanticide, sati
              (the burning of widows), and caste discrimination. His efforts
              were instrumental in the eventual abolition of these practices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carey's innovative methods in agriculture included promoting the
              use of new crops and farming techniques, which significantly
              benefited Indian agriculture.
            </li>
            <li>
              He published numerous grammars and dictionaries in various Indian
              languages, which were crucial resources for future scholars and
              linguists.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carey spent 41 years in India without returning to England,
              dedicating his life entirely to his missionary and educational
              work.
