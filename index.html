        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer
          Science from the Carl R. Ice College of Engineering at Kansas State
          University and a minor in Physics. I graduated in May of 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born in Kansas City, Missouri, but was raised in Shawnee,
          Kansas. I currently reside in the Kansas City area.
        </p>
        <p>
          While attending De Soto High School I discovered my passion for
          computer science; the field that I once thought was only for nerds
          then became the field I wanted to one day work in. My logic-driven
          brain and creative passion both found a home in the field of Computer
          Science. I began my coding journey making games on Unity written in C#
          during my senior year of high school.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through college, I further developed my knowledge of C# in the first
          2.5 years of the Computer Science curriculum at K-State. On the back
          end of college, I developed a deep understanding and love for Python
          and Data Science. I have also learned the fundamental concepts of:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Database Systems</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>Object-Oriented Design, Implementation, and Testing</li>
          <li>Software Architecture and Design</li>
          <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
          <li>Concurrent Software Systems</li>
          <li>Computer Architecture and Operations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          After graduating, I have furthered my education through the pursuit of
          professional certifications from freeCodeCamp's online courses.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most important thing in my life is my faith in Jesus Christ. While
          everything described above is important to my career, learning about
          the love God has for His creation has been the foundation of my life
          for the past few years. June 30th, 2021 is the day that Jesus changed
          my life forever and I received the gift of eternal life.
